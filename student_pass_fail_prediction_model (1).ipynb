        "#Student Pass/Fail Prediction Model\n",
        "This notebook represents a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their academic performance, specifically their grades in various subjects, study time, past failures, and absent days.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Dataset Description\n",
        "The dataset used for this model is based on a student performance data from a Portuguese secondary school, specifically focusing on mathematics. The dataset consists of various features that can impact a student's academic success, as listed below:\n",
        "\n",
        "G1: Grade in the first period (0-20 scale).\n",
        "\n",
        "G2: Grade in the second period (0-20 scale).\n",
        "\n",
        "G3: Final grade (0-20 scale) - This is the target variable we will use to determine pass/fail status.\n",
        "studytime: Amount of study time, represented on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high).\n",
        "\n",
        "failures: Number of past class failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "absences: Number of school absences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The target variable, pass_fail, is derived from the final grade (G3). A student is classified as passing if their final grade is greater than or equal to 10, and failing otherwise. This binary classification allows us to use supervised learning techniques to predict student outcomes based on the available features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Model Overview\n",
        "The model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression). This approach helps improve accuracy and control over-fitting.\n"
