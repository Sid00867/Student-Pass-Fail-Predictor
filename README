The machine learning model - neuralnetwork.py
database - student-mat.csv
jupyter notebook - student_pass_fail_prediction_model (1).ipynb

Please note that the neuralnetwork.py is a Tkinter-GUI based implementation of the model. for the model alone - look into the Jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook also explains the features of the database and other important info

Please place the database in the same relative position w.r.t the code as in the repository when you are testing in your machine
